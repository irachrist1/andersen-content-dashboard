The memorial doesn't just present history—it envelops you in truth that cannot be denied.\n\nIn the quiet halls, among preserved memories, we felt the profound absence of tens of thousands whose futures were stolen. Time seemed to stand still as we confronted both tremendous loss and remarkable human resilience.\n\nOur team walked away transformed, understanding that remembrance carries purpose. It compels us to bear witness, to acknowledge painful truths, and to participate actively in building a future where such atrocities cannot happen again.\n\nRwanda's journey shows us how a nation can confront darkness and still choose light—how remembrance becomes not just retrospection but a foundation for renewal. We honor this legacy by committing ourselves to the values of unity, truth, and collective healing.\n\nRemember. Unite. Renew.",

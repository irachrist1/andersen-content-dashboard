# ContentFlow: Project Overview

## Introduction
ContentFlow is a web-based content management application designed for content creators and marketing teams. It provides a visual, board-style interface to track content items through various stages of the content creation process.

## Purpose
The application aims to streamline the content creation workflow by organizing content items into columns based on their current status: Idea, In Progress, Review, and Done. This approach offers a clear visual representation of each content piece's progress from conception to publication.

## Core Features
- **Kanban-Style Board**: Content items organized in four status columns (Idea → In Progress → Review → Done)
- **Content Item Management**: Create, edit, and move content items through the workflow
- **Platform Categorization**: Mark content for specific platforms (Blog, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube)
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Intuitively move content between status columns
- **URL Integration**: Add live post URLs to published content
- **Preview Functionality**: Preview live posts directly within the interface
- **AI-Assisted Timing**: Suggestions for optimal posting times based on platform and content type

## Target Users

- Social media managers tracking content across creation stages

## User Experience Goals
